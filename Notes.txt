Libraries to use:

IDEAS:


Players:
-Players are 3d models rendered as 2d sprite 

Future ideas:
-Make player models very customizable, give them clothing and such to wear. 


Chat:
-Make private chat where a new text window will show up
-make it such that you have to click on the private window to chat?
    -Like each private chat window has its own input bar 


Public Rooms: 
-These are rooms that the player spawns in. 
-They're suppose to be "3rd spaces" where players can gather and chat.
    -Imagine like club penguin w/ the town and the plaza 

Future ideas:
-Add minigames



Private Room:
-This is the personal canavas of the creater.
-It is a blank page where you can upload photos, change the background color/texture/style,
 add elements like stars or circles, add text. It's pretty much like canva meets social media. 
    -The whole idea is that its very customizable to the players needs. 
    There are two differnt GUI: 
        -One GUI that shows the elements that could be drag and dropped onto the page 
        -Another GUI that shows what elemets are already on the page 
            -This makes it easier to keep track of what elements are on the page,
        -With elemenets you can change color, size, add texture, and lock it in place.
            -this can be done by clicking on the element, or searching though the GUI and 
            clicking on the elemnts
-Players have the ability to draw in the private room too.

Future ideas:
-There are two different private rooms:
    -Rooms where the character sprite loads in 
    -Rooms where the character sprite does NOT load in.
-These are useful for when player either just want to show off their social media posts without 
 player sprites obstructing the view, or when they want the player to interact with the private room
 (imagine like in clubpenguin with igloos)
-Add a player prefab,, where players can upload custom sprites or elements where its Public
 and anyone can use
-Add interactable elements and animations (such as when clicking a like button) 
    -or when clicking on a element (such as oven) it plays an animation - something like the sims.
-3d elements 
-Add elements that are very early 2000's late 90's 


Ideas:
Mini games

PROBLEMS THATS OCCURING WITH THE CHAR:
-If a player types something and a message bubble appears, and a new player joing the room, 
the new player cannot see the message bubble
-All message bubbles should dissapear afte 10 seconds 


-Make players closer to the screen appear in front over people who are further back. 



AESTHETICS:
-Pixelated icons/ very grainy 
-old windows pop up windows 
-marquee text
-gradients 
-3ds objects 
-3d text
